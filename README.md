# nypd-racial-bias
An exploratory analysis on the ‘Stop and Frisk’ data provided by NYPD as part of New York Open Data to test racial bias.

This project contains 2 parts:  
1. To check whether there is evidence of racial bias  
2. And to check if a better predictive model can be built to mnimize invasive frisking.
  
The code contains lot of utility methods to preprocess and clean the data.  
The predictive model used is a Naive bayes classifier since most of the possible features are binary and uncorrelated.

Todo:  
Try other appaoraches to deal with disproportionate class sizes.
